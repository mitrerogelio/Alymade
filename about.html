      <p>I never imagined dedicating myself to making beautiful
      cookies, but God has used so many friends and family to encourage me to take this leap of faith.</p>
      <p>My love for baking really began during a season of hardship, my husband and I had just bought our first home and also
      experienced a miscarriage. It was such a tough season to walk through and sometimes still is, but even through the
      suffering, God has been so good and faithful to us. I would like to share with you a verse that has brought me comfort:</p>
    </article>
    <article class="mid-text">"I will never forget this awful time, as I grieve over my loss. Yet I still dare to hope when I remember this: The
    faithful love of the Lord never ends! His mercies never cease.
    Great is his faithfulness; his mercies begin afresh each morning. I say to myself, “The Lord is my inheritance;
    therefore, I will hope in him!”<br />
    Lamentations 3:20‭-‬24</article>
    <div class="right-image"></div>
    <article class="left-text split">
      <p>Even when our world seemed to be falling apart, God was right there beside us, grieving with us and putting the pieces
      back together.</p>
      <p>Baking is one of the things that brought light back into my life during this time of difficulty. It got my mind off of
      the loss and shifted my focus towards serving others. There is nothing I love more than taking time out of my day to
      create something homemade and delicious to share with those that I love, and now I get to share that with you, too! It
      is such a unique way to surprise someone, it says: I love you, you are important to me!</p>
    </article>
    <article class="bottom-text-grid">
      <p>So that is how my journey started, through loss and hardship, yet God made something beautiful. I am grateful to those
      who have supported me on my cookie journey, especially my wonderful and supportive hubby, who made me this amazing
      website by the way!</p>
      <p>I hope this gave you a little insight into who I am and I hope to create something for you soon!</p>
      <p>Love,</p>
      <p>Alyssa</p>
